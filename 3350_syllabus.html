<p><strong>Timeline for electronic inquiry response:</strong></p>
<p>Please be respectful of the specific reply timelines that faculty members or staff members set for your course. Generally, when a faculty member or staff member receives an electronic inquiry from you they will try to reply within one or two business days of receipt of the email.<strong> It is understood that sometimes the reply may come sooner or in some instances later than this, with a normal response envelope between 1-3 business days. The official email guidelines can be found <a href="https://umanitoba.ca/science/computer-science/email-guidelines-students" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a></strong></p>
<p>If your instructor is sick, they will make a best effort to find a replacement instructor for the classes when sick. If unable to find anyone in a timely manner and if your instructor is well enough to teach remotely, all students registered in the course and section will be e-mailed a notice along with a meeting link (Zoom). In extenuating circumstances, class will be cancelled.</p>
<h2 id="expectations">Expectations</h2>
<p>The required readings and required pre-recorded lectures are <strong><em>required</em></strong> to be completed before the week the material is covered. The class time will be a discussion on the readings and a pre-recorded lecture. <strong>Attendance of your group is mandatory. If your group is called upon and is absent, a penalty will be applied to your group.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Some topics will not be covered in class that are covered in the pre-recorded lectures and readings will be tested.</strong></p>
<h3 id="missing-tests-due-to-illness">Missing tests due to illness</h3>
<p>If you are unable to attend class for a scheduled term test due to illness, you should provide a self-declaration form to your instructor. Accommodations, as appropriate, will attempt to be made.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="missing-deadlines-or-project-goals-due-to-illness">Missing deadlines or project goals due to illness</h3>
<p>COMP 3350 is a course about planning and building a project. <strong>Each iteration is given weeks of time. </strong>To that end, inability to complete agreed upon goals an iteration to due illness or other reasons constitutes bad planning and execution. <strong>The work of an iteration is not designed to be completed in a week (or less….), it is designed to be worked on throughout the iteration.</strong></p>
<h2 id="professional-conduct">Professional Conduct</h2>
<p>This course revolves around a project, a a team that is working together on the project. At all times that you are working with your group (whether online, or in person) University policies, such as the Respectful Work and Learning Environment policy, still apply, as do basic expectations around how students will engage with each other, and with the University. This means that when participating in classes, online meetings, etc., students are expected to behave professionally, and follow the same basic norms as they would in person, such as being dressed appropriately, not being impaired, and participating respectfully.</p>

<h2 id="course-deliverables">Course Deliverables</h2>
<h3 id="project">Project</h3>
<p>The project is a group project that will be submitted in several stages (called “iterations”) and will include a final project presentation. The mark value of each iteration of the project will be given as part of the description of the requirements for that iteration.</p>
<p><strong>Due dates for each of the project iterations are found on the schedule. Late submissions will not receive any marks.</strong></p>
<p>Each student on a project team will be quantitatively evaluated by the other members of the team on the student’s participation. This evaluation will be used to scale the team’s project mark for the individual student. Details will be presented in class.</p>
<h3 id="assignment">Assignment</h3>
<p>There will be one assignment separate from the project that will be done independently. See schedule for due date. The assignment must be submitted to pass the course.</p>
<h3 id="term-tests">Term Tests/Quizzes</h3>
<p>There will be weekly quizzes throughout the term. Quizzes will be held in person during class time. The quizzes will be completed on UMLearn. You must be present in the room, you must bring a laptop or other device with you to write the quiz. <strong>No exceptions will be made to this. If you miss a quiz, there are no make-ups. If you are late, you will be allowed to write, but the cut-off time will still be at the same time as the rest of the class</strong>. Each week's first 30 minutes of class time on the first day of class <strong>will be dedicated to the quiz.</strong> You will be given 30 minutes, and the quizzes must be done without the help of chatGPT or other genAI tools.<strong> You can make handwritten (on paper or notability/good notes style app) notes and reference them during the quizzes. You must have these printed off. You must have written them yourself, and you are not allowed to use anything outside those notes. Quizzes will be done in project groups; however, everyone must submit their own quiz.</strong> There is a Quiz0 in week 0 that you can try out to ensure you understand how to use UMLearn's quiz features.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will be a final, written, in-class test towards the end of the term. Tentative dates for the test/quizzes are posted on the course timetable. You must submit a temporary leave of absence form if you miss the in-class end-of-term test. You will be offered two potential make-up dates in weeks 12/13. Failure to write during your makeup date will result in a 0 on the final term test.</p>
<h3 id="participation">Participation</h3>
<p>In-class participation is required in this course. In class, your team will work on the project or concepts that feed into the project.<strong>&nbsp;Attendance will be taken every class</strong>. You may have up to 3 (A01) or 2 (A02) unexcused absences with no penalty to your grade. These are not freebies. You&nbsp;<strong>must</strong> submit a temporary leave of absence form to your instructor as per the universities policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every class missed after that means a 2% deduction to your <strong>final</strong> grade in the course. <strong>You must attend at least 80% of the scheduled classes to pass the course.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h2 id="voluntary-withdrawal">Voluntary withdrawal</h2>
<p>The last day to drop this course is <a href="https://umanitoba.ca/registrar/important-dates-deadlines">January 17, 2025</a>. If you drop the course before this date, you the course will not appear on your transcript at all.</p>
<p>The last day to withdraw voluntarily from this course is <a href="https://umanitoba.ca/registrar/important-dates-deadlines">March 19, 2024</a>. If you drop the course after the revision deadline, but before this date, the course will appear on your transcript, but no final grade will be assigned. If you do not voluntarily withdraw from the course before the withdrawal deadline, you will be assigned a final grade.</p>
<p>You can feel free to get in touch with your instructor if you have any questions or concerns about your progress or if you’re looking for advice or strategies about how to improve your scores before the voluntary withdrawal deadline.</p>
<p><a href="https://umanitoba.ca/registrar/important-dates-deadlines">See the important dates page for more details</a>.</p>
<h2 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>Academic misconduct is a very serious offense and will be dealt with in accordance with the University’s discipline bylaw. Examples of academic misconduct include:</p>
<ul>
<li>submitting work which is not entirely your own, or providing your work to another student or students;</li>
<li>use of unauthorized material or inappropriate collaboration while producing work;</li>
<li>writing any part of work for another person; or</li>
<li>having another person write any part of your work for you,</li>
</ul>
<p>where “work” includes any material submitted for evaluation in the course. This includes assignments, labs, tests, and final examinations.</p>
<p>You will be required to confirm your agreement to an Honesty Declaration before submitting assignments or writing any test or exam.</p>
<p><strong>All students in this course must read and meet the expectations described in the <a href="https://sci.umanitoba.ca/cs/expectations/">Expectations for Individual Work in Computer Science</a>. Failure to do so can result in serious consequences.</strong></p>
<p>Specifically, in COMP 3350:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">The&nbsp;<strong>project</strong> that you will build with your team is group work and, as such, is not subject to the same individual coursework; you are explicitly permitted to work on a team to complete the project.</span>&nbsp;All code and deliverables that you and your team submit as part of the project must be written by you and your team, or otherwise adequately cited.</li>
<li>The individual assignment and tests in the course are individual coursework and must be completed independently.</li>
</ul>
<p>More detailed instructions and expectations may be provided with each activity.</p>
<p>If you are ever uncertain about what constitutes academic misconduct, please contact your instructor <strong>before</strong> you submit questionable material for grading.</p>
<p></p>
<h2 id="using-copyright-material">Illness/Temporary Leave of Absence</h2>
<p>Due to the group-based nature of this course, most deadlines are not flexible, as very few deliverables are completed individually. For group projects, if you are sick at any point, deadlines will remain unchanged. It is your responsibility to communicate with your group members to determine how to handle the situation. Just as in a real-world scenario, if one team member is unavailable, the rest of the team steps in to ensure progress. Group member evaluations are part of the course and directly impact grades. Therefore, if you are frequently unavailable throughout the course, it will affect your final grade.</p>
<p>The major assignment will be released toward the end of the term, and you will have approximately two weeks to complete it. If you cannot meet the deadline, you must submit a Temporary Leave of Absence form at least <strong>24 hours before the due date</strong> to request a 2-day extension. This form must be submitted to your instructor for approval.</p>
<p>Quizzes are short and weekly. Please note that <strong>missing a quiz will result in a grade of 0</strong>, as there are no make-up quizzes or extensions available.</p>
<p>The final term test is tentatively scheduled during class time, as noted in the course schedule. If you cannot write the test due to illness, you must submit a Temporary Leave of Absence form <strong>between 12 and 24 hours before the test</strong> to inform your instructor. If you recover in time and space is available in another section, you may be allowed to write with that section. Otherwise, you can write the test during week 12 or 13 (dates TBD). Failure to write the final term test by the end of the term will result in a grade of 0.</p>
<p><span style="color: #cd2026;">You may only submit <strong>one Temporary Leave of Absence form per term in this course.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;If you require additional accommodations, you will be referred to this policy and directed to contact a faculty advisor.</span></p>
